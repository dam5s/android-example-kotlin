# Android Example  Kotlin
An example of basic Android application setup using Kotlin. It can run Robolectric and Espresso tests.

This is an example built from the three following sources

 *  [Deckard Gradle](https://github.com/robolectric/deckard-gradle) (from the Robolectric team)
    demonstrates the base structure for running Robolectric tests and Espresso tests through gradle.
 *  [tests-app-robolectric-junit](https://github.com/blundell/tests-app-robolectric-junit) (by Paul Blundell)
    demonstrates how to use a components based structure in order to make Robolectric tests well supported by Android Studio.
 *  [Kotlin Android Tutorial](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html)
    On how to convert the existing Java sctructure to Kotlin.

I haven't done any extra work on making the code nicer using Kotlin.
This project is just a nice minimal starter for any android project using Kotlin and Robolectric.
